.. Note that the reStructuredText (rst) 'note' directive is not used,
   because github does not style these in a way that makes them obvious.
   If this document is ever put into a sphinx scroll,
   therefore outside of the github readme,
   the adjustment should be made to make notes use the rst 'note' directive.

Data structure
--------------

The connexions authoring environment is made up of **three content objects**:

:Documents: Modular HTML documents that contain written text by one or more authors.
:Binders: Collections of Documents bound together to make comprehensive subject matter from otherwise disconnected pieces. These could also be called collections, books, binders, scrollls, etc.
:Resources: Any *file* that is referenced within a document. This can be anything from an image to a suplimentary PDF.

Documents and binders have the following required pieces of data (aka metadata):

:title: A human readable title or name for the document.
:id: (Autogenerated) (saved internally as a UUID v4) (The user should never see this except indirectly in the url.)
:creation-datetime: (Autogenerated) The date and time the item was created.
:last-modified-datetime: (Computed) The date and time the item was last revised/edited.

Optional pieces of data (aka metadata):

:license: (Defaults to CC-BY-40) A protective license for the content is under.
:language: (Defaults to en-US) The language the content is written in.
:summary: A brief summary (aka abstract) of the document or binder.
:derived-from-*: The source or origin this work is derived from, where '*' can be url, isbn, or (internal) id.

Documents contains a content body of data as well. Binders have a tree or table of contents structure rather than a content body. The binder tree structures can have an infinite depth.

Resources are files which could be binary or text based data. Resources require a *mimetype* and *hash* (SHA1 hash is autogenerated).

Attribution are a set of data on document or binders that ascribe the work to people and/or organizations. They do not and should never be confused with the permissions someone has on a piece of work. Attributions are author(s), translator(s), illustrator(s), editor(s), and copyright-holder(s). Furthermore, attribution can be a simple name (e.g. 'Edgar Allen Poe') or a user id associated user authentication and profile system (i.e. an osc-accounts user id).
